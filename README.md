# What is this

This is a repository that contains my up-to-date CV.

You can find the generated versions of the CV on http://cv.raphink.info

# Building

The CV is optimized to be built into a PDF using `lualatex`.

In order to achieve this, you need:

   * A LaTeX distribution (TeXLive 2012 recommended);
   * LuaTeX;
   * MinionPro and MyriadPro fonts (you can find them with Acrobat Reader).

To build the PDF CVs, type `make`.
