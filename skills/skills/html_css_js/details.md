Like many people of my generation, the web stack was one of the first experiences I had of client-side programming. In the beginning of the 2000s, I was interested in what was then called DHTML, or how to use JavaScript to make the browser experience more enjoyable and dynamic. In 2003, I coded a <a href="http://dicionarii.free.fr/">dictionary interface in JavaScript</a>, using js files for the data. Retrospectively, this was obviously not the best way to do it (a database would have been a better choice).

As I continued to progress in my job as a sysadmin, I have often had the occasion to design web interfaces for tools I implemented or developed. User interface and ease of use is a priority for me.
