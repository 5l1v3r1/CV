#### Lenses

When the Augeas project was first presented to me in 2007, I was very enthusiastic and started contributing new lenses very early. I quickly became the main contributor of Augeas lenses.

#### API contributions

Later on, I contributed C code for the API, as well bindings code for Python/Ruby and Perl (which I maintain on the CPAN).

#### Augeasproviders

I joined Dominic Cleal when he started the Augeasproviders project and am now the main developer.

#### Talks and trainings

I have talked about Augeas at various conferences and have written and taught a one-day course on using Augeas.
