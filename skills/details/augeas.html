<h5>Lenses</h5>

<p>When the Augeas project was first presented to me in 2007, I was very enthusiastic and started contributing new lenses very early. I quickly became the main contributor of Augeas lenses.</p>

<h5>API contributions</h5>

<p>Later on, I contributed C code for the API, as well bindings code for Python/Ruby and Perl (which I maintain on the CPAN).</p>

<h5>Augeasproviders</h5>

<p>I joined Dominic Cleal when he started the Augeasproviders project and am now the main developer.</p>

<h5>Talks and trainings</h5>

<p>I have talked about Augeas at various conferences and have written and taught a one-day course on using Augeas.</p>
