After learning HTML and JavaScript, I soon came to the conclusion I need a server-side language for some websites. PHP is the first server-side language I learned, both because of its simplicity, and for its ease of deployment on most free hosting platforms.

I still use PHP occasionally when I need a little bit of server-side code with a very simple Apache configuration.

I have also had the occasion to work on Symphony Enterprise applications in the past.
